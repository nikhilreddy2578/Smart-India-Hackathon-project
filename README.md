Smart India Hackathon - 2019
APPLICATION TO REPORT AND FIX AIR,WATER AND SOUND POLLUTION.
Category : Sustainable Environment
Problem:
Every day we come across several sources of pollution, polluting the very basics of our 
lives- Rivers, Land, Air and Noise. We know nothing about who/where to report it and how. 
We suggest an Innovative way to identify the sources of pollution in your area, get it 
prioritised through people votes, escalate it to the concerned authorities, keep a track of the 
progress and get notified of the actions taken. It will provide an End-2-End tool to battle 
pollution democratically partnering with Govt.
Company: CDK GLOBAL PRIVATE LIMITED.
Description :
Pollution in India has become a major problem these days. It’s not always possible to the 
authorities to have an eye on each and every pollution causing area and problem. Effective 
participation of residents in reporting, helps in solving the pollution problem. People have 
chaos on who to report .Our app aims at linking the local residents of a city to the 
corresponding authorities, which will help them to overcome many difficulties and allow 
them to report a problem with ease.
